# **Hey everyone !** 😎

I'm Jasmine DRAPERI and I'm based in Grenoble, France.

I am currently training as an Application designer and developer at Simplon Grenoble. We learn the front and back end. We do the same with Ops Dev.

**I am looking for an internship from June 17 to October 11, 2024!**

## Talk about me 🌺
I like the training I am currently taking, and I hope to be able to discover many more things! Outside of work, I enjoy playing video games, drawing or hanging out with my friends and family!

## Projects 📚

My projects are done as part of my training. We do it every two weeks.
